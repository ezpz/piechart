### Rationale

Pie charts, for all their popularity, are one of the least functional chart 
types for presenting accurate information. On the contrary, bar charts do an
excellent job for accuracy but are less popular among various presentation
media. 

This work aims to bridge the gap between the two allowing for both views in an
interactive fashion.
